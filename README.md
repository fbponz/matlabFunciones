# matlabFunciones

Here I share some of my  functions, which I use in my diary work.

## Contents:

-**RemoveNaN.m** -> Remove from array Any NaN, and assign a like a new value the anterior value.

### Robotics:

-**modelDifferential.m** -> Calculate Odometry like function of velocity wheels (Robot with topology Differential).

-**odometry.m** -> Calculate Odometry using lineal Velocity of the robot and Yaw.

### Signals

-**Average1of20.m** -> Function to obtain an average each 20 values. 

-**AverageAccumulate20.m** -> Function to obtain an average in each value, taking the last 19 values. To do it.

-**CordicAlgorithm.m** -> Function to descompose in sinus and cosinus using Cordic Algorithm.

-**DetectFlankSignal.m**-> Function to Detect the down flank of until a raising flank in a signal.

-**InclinationOfSignal.m** -> Function to Calculate Inclination between two points. In Each iteration the function save a value to use in the next iteration.
